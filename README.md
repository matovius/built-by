# BUILT BY

Built By is a tool for developers that are tired of always using the same adjective in the footers of all their projects. You'll get a suggestion from a curated list of adjectives, perfectly crafted for use in any project. Whichever one you fancy, you can use, no strings attached.

On load, click the **Cycle** button to randomly generate an adjective, rinse and repeat.
